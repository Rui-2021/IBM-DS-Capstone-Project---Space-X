# IBM-DS-Capstone-Project---Space-X

This capstone project was prepared in context of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The capstone project is a set of 6 Python notebooks  developed to   evaluate the probability of  Falcon 9 first stage successfully landing . SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determined if the first stage will land, then the cost of a launch can be calculated. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
